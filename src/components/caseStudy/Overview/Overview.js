                Dopefolio is an Open-Source project which is a simple and clean multi-page portfolio website template for developers. I created this project for developers to quickly build a good-looking and fast-performing multi-page portfolio without having to code their portfolio from scratch.
                <br />
                <br />
                Since the launch of this project, It has received more than 2k stars on Github and it has also got featured on hundreds of sites and CSS-tricks.com has also featured this template as the hottest frontend tool of 2021 in one of their articles which you can find here
                <br />
                <br />
                Dopefolio is now being used by thousands of developers globally and it has helped many people in landing jobs & opportunities which makes me happy that my creation is helping other people in building their careers.
                <br />
                <br />
                It has many other features like Dopefolio's repo contains a playground link which people can use to test the template with different theme colours to find their own preferred primary colour for the template.
